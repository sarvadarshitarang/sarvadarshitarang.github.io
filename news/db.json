During those days even a family lady having great responsibilities of home making and educating kids and taking care of family, she was still focused on keeping flag safe and also reminding family to hoist it every year. Though she was not literate but having great Dharma and Desha Bhakti is still an inspiration to the young women of today. She had 12 kids and she took care of Flag as if its her 13th kid!!!",

				"description": "Ross 508 b is a super Earth exoplanet that orbits an M-type star. Its mass is 4 Earths, it takes 10.8 days to complete one orbit of its star, and is 0.05366 AU from its star. Its discovery was announced in 2022. Its orbit takes it in, and out, of its star's habitable zone. Such a planet may be able to retain water on its surface, and will be an important target for future observations to study the possibility of life around low-mass stars like the M dwarf it orbits. Red dwarfs, which constitute three-quarters of the stars in our galaxy and exist in large numbers in the vicinity of our solar system, are excellent targets to find exoplanets in our neighborhood.",
